Netscaler
- Netscaler uses the Nitro API to query data from ADC devices (previously known as Netscaler)
- There is no official Python SDK to interface with Netscaler devices that is up to date
- This is the Nitro API documentation https://developer-docs.netscaler.com/en-us/adc-nitro-api/current-release/api-reference
- Base url for API is http://hostname/nitro/v1
- Use the /config/login to get the session ID, which is the token
- Is ssh enabled?

Meraki
- This is the Meraki Python SDK https://github.com/meraki/dashboard-api-python
- This is the API documentation https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v1/overview/
- example base url is https://hostname/api/v1 for API documentation
- I need to have a Meraki API Key, which is generated the the dashboard by account
- Need to be passed as a bearer token `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

vManage
- This is the vManage API documentation https://developer.cisco.com/docs/sdwan/20-11/sd-wan-vmanage-v20-11/
- This is the latest python SDK https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/python-viptela/tree/master
- Sample script
`
from vmanage.api.authentication import Authentication
from vmanage.api.device import Device

# Set your vManage credentials and host
vmanage_host = "your_vmanage_host"
vmanage_username = "your_username"
vmanage_password = "your_password"

# Authenticate
auth = Authentication(host=vmanage_host, user=vmanage_username, password=vmanage_password).login()

# Initialize the Device API
device_api = Device(auth, vmanage_host)

# Retrieve device configurations
device_configs = device_api.get_device_config_list('all')

# Print device hostnames
for device in device_configs:
    print(device.get('host-name'))
